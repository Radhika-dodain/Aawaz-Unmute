## 🚩 Problem Statement

In India, deeply rooted stigmas around menstruation, mental health, hygiene and many more with often silence conversations, leads to confusion, shame, and misinformation. While some online resources exist, they often:

❌ Lack curated, relatable stories specifically addressing these sensitive topics.

❌ Are not available in regional languages, limiting accessibility for many.

❌ Do not provide a safe, private way to learn and reflect without fear of judgment.

❌ Miss engaging formats (audio stories, quizzes) that work in low-literacy or low-connectivity environments.

## 💡 Solution

**Awaaz Unmute** uses **short, relatable audio stories** in regional languages to break stigmas and enable conversations in a safe, private environment. It allows:

- **Listeners** to access stories privately and submit anonymous feedback-
    ~ They can send their own stories in words using the form if they want us to create an audio story of it. 
    ~ They can also send requests to related NGOs for help using this feature.

  - **Writers/Voice Actors/Translators** can submit their work here-
    ~ presently we can provide them contributor badges for their portfolios but in future we can use try to get NGOs funds and some editorial company's CSR funding.

- **Educators** to use stories in classrooms with integrated quizzes-
   
    ~ 


- **NGOs** to collect anonymous insights for targeted awareness drives.
